# Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¥
## Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It employs data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. The project demonstrates both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering approaches.

## Features
- ### Content-Based Filtering:

  - Recommends movies based on metadata such as genre, cast, crew, and plot keywords.
  - Utilizes cosine similarity and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for relevance scoring.
- ### Collaborative Filtering:

  - Recommends movies by analyzing user rating patterns using matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- ### Hybrid Approach:

  - Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy.
- ### Interactive User Interface (Optional):

  - Provides an easy-to-use interface to search and get recommendations (implemented with Streamlit).
## Technologies Used
- ### Programming Language: Python
- ### Libraries/Frameworks:
- ### Pandas
- ### NumPy
- ### Scikit-learn
- ### NLTK (for text processing)
- ### Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
- ### Streamlit (for the interactive UI)
- ### Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project contains metadata and user ratings for movies. It includes:

- Movie details such as genres, cast, crew, and overviews.
- User rating data to analyze user preferences.
- **Source:** Kaggle - Movie Dataset

## How It Works
- ### Content-Based Filtering:

  - Extracts relevant features (e.g., genres, keywords) from the movie metadata.
  - Computes similarity scores between movies to recommend similar content.
- ### Collaborative Filtering:

  - Creates a user-item interaction matrix from the ratings dataset.
  - Predicts user preferences for unrated movies based on patterns in the rating data.
- ### Hybrid Model:

  - Combines both approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.

## Visualizations:
- Heatmaps for user ratings.
- Bar plots showing top-rated movies.
  
## Future Enhancements
- Add real-time movie data using APIs (e.g., The Movie Database API - TMDb).
- Enhance collaborative filtering with deep learning techniques.
- Add user login functionality for personalized recommendations.
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
